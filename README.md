## About
This is a minor mode for emacs, that provide some IDE features for the basic-mode , it has flycheck,company and helm support,

Provide 3 interpreters [cbmbasic](https://github.com/mist64/cbmbasic),[Bas 2.5](http://www.moria.de/~michael/bas/) and of course [VICE](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/).
For the moment, it's focus on the c64 support.

		basic-ide-x64-executable "/usr/bin/x64"
		basic-ide-x64-kernal "/usr/lib/vice/C64/kernal"
		basic-ide-vice-simon-disk "/path/to/simonbasic/d64/disc"
		basic-ide-completion-backend '("completion" "words" ))
